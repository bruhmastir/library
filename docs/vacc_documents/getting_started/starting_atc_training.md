# Getting Started as an ATC in the Arabian vACC

Looking to become an Air Traffic Controller on the VATSIM Network, controlling one of the Middle East's busiest airspaces? Here's everything you need to know to get started.

## 📌 Requirements & Expectations

Becoming a controller requires:

VATSIM follows a system of graduated ratings that determine the positions you can control, similar to real-world ATC training.

Check your status and how to join here: [Joining Arabian](https://library.arabian-vacc.com/vacc_documents/getting_started/joining_arabian/)
