# Transfer & Visiting

## Introduction

!!! warning
    **Visiting Controller Applications are Currently Closed**

    Due to high training demand within the Arabian vACC and limited training capacity, we are **not accepting new visiting controller applications at this time**.

    We apologize for the inconvenience and appreciate your understanding.

    Please check this page regularly for updates, as the status may change in the future.


This policy outlines the process for handling **transfer** and **visiting controllers** in the **Arabian vACC**, whether you're transferring from within VATMENA or visiting from another division. It is designed in full alignment with the:

- **VATSIM Transfer and Visiting Controller Policy**, and
- **VATMENA Transfer Policy**

The **Arabian vACC** is part of the **Middle East & North Africa Division (VATMENA)** and includes the following **three FIRs**:

- **Doha FIR**
- **Muscat FIR**
- **U.A.E FIR**

Each FIR has its own **local regulations** and **training procedures**. All visiting controllers must be familiar with the specific expectations for the FIR(s) they wish to operate in.
