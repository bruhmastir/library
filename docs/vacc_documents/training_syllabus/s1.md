## Scope
This syllabus outlines the structure and learning pathway for students pursuing the S1 rating within the Arabian vACC.

Students will achieve the course objectives through a combination of independent study and guided practical training. Core learning materials are provided via the Moodle platform and the Arabian vACC Library.

In addition to self-study, students will receive one-on-one practical instruction from mentors and instructors. Active participation and engagement are encouraged throughout your training.

Students are also encouraged to ask questions and seek support in the ATC Training category on the Arabian vACC Discord server.

!!! warning
    All documentation in this section is intended solely for use on the VATSIM network and must not be used for real-world aviation operations. The authors disclaim any liability for personal injury or death resulting from misuse of this material.

## Grading Criteria
Controllers will be graded during each session with a mentor or instructor. These evaluations are designed using Competency-Based Training and Assessment (CBTA) principles to ensure that controllers are progressing in both skills and knowledge.

### Performance Levels
Controllers will be assessed according to their **competency** and **performance** in each session. The following performance levels exist:

- **Below:** The controller's performance is below the expected standard for their current rating or endorsement.
- **At:** The controller meets the expected standard for their rating or endorsement.
- **Above:** The controller exceeds the expected standard for their rating or endorsement.

Controllers should aim to be **"At"** the expected performance level as they progress through their training. If a controller is rated **"Below,"** additional sessions will be required to address and correct the issues identified during training.

### Input Required from the Mentor or Instructor
In addition to performance evaluation, controllers will be assessed based on the level of input required from the mentor or instructor during the session. This helps identify the controller's ability to operate independently and effectively. The following input levels are used:

- **Constant:** The controller requires frequent reminders throughout the session, indicating a need for further development.
- **Intermittent:** The controller needs occasional reminders, showing progress but still requiring guidance.
- **Minor:** The controller requires very few reminders, indicating good progress and near independence.
- **N/A:** The controller requires no reminders, demonstrating full autonomy in their role.

Controllers should strive for **"N/A"** where no input is required from the mentor or instructor. If a controller is rated as **"Constant,"** additional sessions will be necessary to address gaps in their knowledge or performance.

This grading system helps ensure that controllers receive the support and training they need to meet the required standards for their ratings and endorsements. Continuous feedback and targeted training sessions are crucial for controllers to advance to higher levels of proficiency.

## Theoretical Course

- Update the FIR-specific sector file for each AIRAC cycle, both manually (via AeroNav) and using EuroScope’s automatic updater.
- Install and configure one of the supported audio clients.
- Connect to both the VATSIM network and the SweatBox training server.
- Accurately record relevant information in the departure and arrival list datablocks.

### Coordination
- Explain the purpose of coordination in air traffic control operations.
- Coordinate effectively with relevant controllers to support the roles of Ground Movement Planner (GMP) and Ground Movement Control (GMC), including but not limited to:
  - Issuing clearances
  - Managing flow restrictions (e.g. MDIs, CTOTs, EOBTs)
  - Handling runway changes
- Perform a proper handover to, and take-over from, another controller.

### Coding System
- Identify the difference between an ICAO and IATA code.

### Flight Planning
- Explain the purpose of a flight plan and how pilots file them.
- Amend flight plans using both EuroScope and the TopSky Flight Plan dialog.
- Use the Arabian vACC Standard Route Database or the VFPC function to identify and correct invalid routings up to the FIR boundary.
- Assign appropriate initial altitudes and levels based on departure instructions (e.g. clearance from APP/ACC or as per a SID).

| Session Objectives | - Access the eAIP (if available) and review the various chart types, highlighting their features and usage.<br>- Introduce the basics of altimetry, including definitions of QNH and QFE, and explain where each is applied operationally.<br>- Discuss the roles and responsibilities of adjacent control positions such as AIR, FIN, APP, and ACC. Cover what each position handles, how they are represented in EuroScope, and provide examples of scenarios where coordination is necessary.<br>- Use the VFPC plugin to identify any lateral or vertical flight plan restrictions specific to the aerodrome.<br>- Learn to recognize common errors in flight plans, such as incorrect routings for SIDs, inappropriate requested flight levels (RFLs) for direction of flight, or RFLs that conflict with Letters of Agreement.<br>- Explain and practice stand allocation using GRPlugin, referencing the procedures in the local SOP.<br>- Explain and practice the use of conditional clearances.<br>- Introduce the structure and procedures for issuing VFR clearances for circuit traffic and CTR entry/exit.<br>- Review and consolidate the key objectives covered in previous sessions to reinforce understanding and application. |

| Session Objectives | - Discuss the purpose of flow management techniques, including the use of CTOTs and MDIs, and provide an introduction to the A-CDM concept.<br>- Explain the operational benefits of implementing flow control measures, particularly in managing demand and maintaining efficiency.<br>- Introduce the application of flow management techniques in high-traffic situations to help maintain orderly and safe operations.<br>- Review the overall objectives of the course and consolidate the student’s knowledge in preparation for the final exam.<br>- In most cases, students should be recommended for their exam at this stage. If it is clear they are not yet ready, conduct one additional consolidation session to address any remaining gaps. |
