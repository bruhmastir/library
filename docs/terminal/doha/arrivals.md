# 3. Arrivals
## 3.1 STAR, Approach, and Runway assignment
### 3.1.1 Initial contact
Upon initial contact, arriving aircraft must be assigned a STAR, the designated arrival runway, and the expected approach type for the respective aerodrome.

!!! example
    **Pilot**: "Doha Radar, good evening, QTR49Q passing FL320 for FL210 inbound HAYYA. Information X on board."

    **Controller**: "QTR49Q, Doha Radar, good evening, identified, cleared HAYYA1V arrival, expect ILS approach runway 34R, information X correct."

    **Pilot**: "Cleared HAYYA1V arrival, expect ILS approach runway 34R, QTR49Q."

If an aircraft has not confirmed receipt of the ATIS information, the current QNH must be communicated to them.

### 3.1.2 STAR Assignment
The Doha Terminal Maneuvering Area (TMA) provides various arrival procedures, including two distinct routes to either the east or west downwind, a trombone point merge-style arrival, and a shorter direct procedure.  

By default, aircraft should be assigned the STAR that allows for the shortest transition to their final approach. However, during periods of high-traffic intensity, the trombone point merge-style arrival shall be assigned to optimize sequencing and manage the flow into the terminal airspace effectively.

!!! note
    It is essential to highlight that the following arrival procedures are applicable to both Doha (OTBD) and Hamad (OTHH) airports. These procedures are not airport-specific.  

    Aircraft can be sequenced on any of the STARs that guide them either to the east or west downwinds, depending on sector capacity and controller workload. The most efficient routing options should always be utilized to avoid having one downwind more saturated than the other.

### 3.1.3 Instrument Approach
The ILS approach is typically the preferred approach type. Aircraft may be cleared for a visual approach provided the conditions outlined in Section 3.1.4 are met.  

While RNP approaches are available, they should only be assigned if specifically requested by the pilot or if other circumstances, such as ILS unserviceability, necessitate their use.

### 3.1.4 Visual approach
Visual approaches may be initiated by Approach (APP) or requested by the pilot. When a pilot accepts a visual approach, they confirm their ability to visually maintain safe terrain clearance and take responsibility for ensuring a safe landing interval behind the preceding aircraft.  

APP may initiate a visual approach under the following conditions:
- The pilot agrees to the visual approach;  
- The pilot reports having the preceding aircraft in sight and accepts responsibility for maintaining separation;  
- A caution regarding potential wake turbulence has been issued, where applicable.  

If the minimum wake turbulence separation cannot be guaranteed, controllers may offer a visual approach, allowing the pilot to maintain visual and wake turbulence separation from preceding traffic.  

### 3.1.5 Change of runway or approach type
Controllers must not initiate a change to the approach type or runway within 30 NM of touchdown. However, pilots may request a change to the approach type or runway at any time.  

## 3.2 Speed control
### 3.2.1 General
Whenever possible, aircraft should be assigned speeds in accordance with Section 3.2.2 to ensure separation is maintained.  

When required for separation, speeds within the recommended range may be used, as long as they do not exceed the maximum or minimum limits for the respective segment.  

To minimize controller workload, aircraft may also be instructed to adhere to the published speeds on the STAR.  

!!! example
    **Controller**: "QTR49Q, maintain STAR speeds."

### 3.2.2 Published and recommended speeds
The speed limits and recommended speeds within different segments of the Doha terminal area is as follows:

|  Speed Range  |              Arrival Segment              |
|:-------------:|:-----------------------------------------:|
| 230 - 210 kts |           Initial approach phase          |
|    180 kts    | Base leg/closed heading to final approach |
|    180 kts    |                Until 10 DME               |
|    160 kts    |                Until 4 DME                |

!!! note
    Aircraft subject to speed restrictions on final with DME constraints may be instructed by ATC to comply with "`STANDARD SPEEDS`" meaning pilots are expected to maintain these speeds until final approach.  

    For the A380, the speed sequence is as follows: 180 until 10 DME and 160 kts until 5 DME.

All speed restrictions must be adhered to as accurately as possible. Aircraft unable to comply with these restrictions must notify ATC in advance and specify the speeds they can maintain. Pilots should also inform ATC if circumstances require a speed adjustment for any reason.  

To ensure accurate spacing, pilots are requested to comply with speed adjustments as promptly as practicable, considering their operational constraints.  

If traffic sequencing does not require speed limitations, ATC will advise, “NO ATC SPEED RESTRICTION.”  

### 3.2.3 Deviation from published and recommended speeds
Deviation from the recommended speeds from the downwind onwards is not advised, as it affects the turn radius and turn rate, potentially leading to a localizer overshoot. Additionally, maintaining these speeds provides controllers with more time to manage aircraft on the downwind leg.  

For aircraft conducting a straight-in approach from the initial STAR fix, speed control is generally not required until the aircraft is established on the final approach course, unless necessary for separation.  

However, it is recommended that traffic be instructed to maintain a maximum speed of 180 knots when 10 NM from the landing threshold to ensure approach stabilization criteria are met.  

High speeds may be allowed in the terminal area (TMA) as long as the aircraft is not expected to make turns exceeding 30 degrees of course change in any given arrival segment, and provided the traffic level and controller workload permit.

## 3.3 Descent profile
### 3.3.1 General
Descent clearances must be issued in accordance with published level restrictions and the procedures outlined in Sections 3.3.2 and 3.3.3.  

When aircraft are expected to follow the STAR vertical profile and comply with all published speed and level restrictions, the phrase "`DESCEND VIA STAR TO <cleared level>`" shall be used.  

When issuing a "`DESCEND VIA STAR`" or "`DESCEND UNRESTRICTED`" clearance, aircraft must not be cleared to descend below the next published at-or-above crossing restriction unless compliance with that restriction is assured, assuming an idle thrust descent. This ensures all crossing restrictions are met, even in the case of an incorrectly programmed FMS or improper use of aircraft automation.  

Aircraft should not be cleared to descend below the current minimum radar altitude to ensure sufficient obstacle and terrain clearance.  

Intermediate levels may be assigned to ensure proper traffic separation between arrivals. When traffic is being handed off to the Final Approach (FIN) sector, aircraft shall not be cleared below 6000 ft.

### 3.3.3 Descent Procedure - Doha 33 / Hamad 34s

## 3.4 Lateral Profile
### 3.4.1 General
The lateral design of Standard Terminal Arrival Routes (STARs) within the Doha Terminal Maneuvering Area (TMA) ensures separation between arriving traffic, departing aircraft, and arrivals to adjacent airports. However, when traffic conditions allow, controllers may authorize direct routings to aircraft in order to reduce track miles and improve efficiency.

### 3.4.2 Direct Routings
Direct routings within the Doha Terminal Maneuvering Area (TMA) shall only be issued when traffic levels are low and operational conditions permit. Prior to issuing a direct routing, controllers must assess the potential for conflicts with other traffic. Limitations and guidance on permissible direct routings for arriving aircraft are outlined in Sections 3.4.3 and 3.4.4.

During periods of high arrival traffic, direct routings may also be issued from the “trombone” segment of the arrival procedure directly to a fix on the downwind leg. This technique is preferred over vectoring in high-density scenarios, as it aids in sequencing and reduces overall controller workload.

!!! example
    **Controller**: “QTR8721, turn right direct EGNUG, rejoin the STAR.”

### 3.4.4 Direct Routing Procedure - Doha 33 / Hamad 34s


## 3.5 Final Approach Sequencing
### 3.5.1 Final Descent
Descent for final approach shall be issued to the appropriate platform altitude for the respective runway, as specified in Section 3.5.3.

Clearances to descend below the platform altitude are generally not recommended. However, such clearances may be issued provided the descent does not go below the minimum radar vectoring altitude (MRVA) for the respective sector and horizontal separation with other traffic is assured.

When issuing descent clearances, particular attention shall be paid to aircraft operating on opposite downwind legs. Assigning the same altitude to aircraft on opposing downwind legs is strongly discouraged, as it increases the risk of loss of separation in the event of a localiser overshoot.

An Instrument Landing System (ILS) clearance does not imply authorization to descend to the final approach altitude. Aircraft must intercept the glide path from the last assigned altitude. Descent below this altitude shall not occur unless explicitly cleared in accordance with applicable procedures.

### 3.5.2 Final Sequencing
Air traffic controllers shall ensure that adequate separation is maintained at all times during the base-to-final segment. When sequencing aircraft, due consideration must be given to the wake turbulence category, aircraft performance characteristics, and the assigned landing runway.

Speed control shall be applied in accordance with the procedures outlined in Section 3.2.2.

If prescribed separation cannot be maintained, aircraft may be instructed to maintain visual wake turbulence separation, provided meteorological conditions permit. If visual separation is not possible, the affected aircraft shall be instructed to go around and shall be subsequently re-sequenced.

When vectoring aircraft from the downwind leg, a standard 90-degree base leg and a 30-degree intercept angle to the final approach course shall be used.

### 3.5.3 Longitudinal Separation Requirements
#### 3.5.3.1 Single Runway Operations
During single-runway operations at Doha-Hamad and Doha Airports, a minimum longitudinal separation of **7 nautical miles (NM)** shall be maintained between arriving aircraft, unless alternate separation has been coordinated with the appropriate AIR controller.

#### 3.5.3.2 Low Visibility Operations
Under Low Visibility Operations (LVO), a minimum longitudinal separation of **7 nautical miles (NM)** shall be strictly applied between all arriving aircraft.

### 3.5.4 Platform Altitudes
#### 3.5.4.1 Doha-Hamad (OTHH)
Aircraft establishing on final approach at Doha-Hamad International Airport shall be cleared to the platform altitudes specified below. These altitudes are mandatory for all operations and shall be strictly observed, particularly during independent parallel approach procedures.
