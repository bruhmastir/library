# 7. Letters of Agreement (LoA)
## 7.1 Overview of Existing LoAs
Letters of Agreement (LoAs) are formal documents established between adjacent FIRs or sectors to define procedures for the transfer of control, coordination, and traffic management. Controllers must be familiar with any applicable LoAs governing their area of responsibility, as these agreements supplement the general provisions of ICAO and local SOPs, ensuring seamless cooperation and safety.

The following Letters of Agreement are available:

- Muscat & Jeddah FIR  (soon™)
- Muscat & Karachi FIR  (soon™)
- Muscat & Mumbai FIR  (soon™)
- Muscat & Sanaa FIR  (soon™)
- Muscat & U.A.E FIR  (soon™)

## 7.2 Coordination Levels & Handoff Requirements
LoAs specify the required levels of coordination for different traffic situations, including mandatory information exchanges, handoff points, transfer of communication protocols, and separation standards at FIR boundaries. Controllers must adhere strictly to these requirements to avoid misunderstandings and ensure timely transfer of control.

## 7.3 Specific Routes & Corridors
Certain LoAs may define specific routes, airways, or traffic corridors that require special coordination or handling. These routes often facilitate optimized traffic flow between FIRs or sectors, reduce controller workload, and improve safety margins. Controllers should ensure that aircraft follow these designated routes where applicable.

## 7.4 Delegated/Controlled Airspace Agreements
Some LoAs include provisions for delegated or controlled airspace where one FIR or sector assumes responsibility for control beyond the normal boundary. Such agreements detail the extent and limitations of delegated control, including altitudes, frequencies, and types of control permitted. Controllers must operate within these parameters and maintain close communication with the responsible authorities.

## 7.5 Phraseology & Timing for Coordination
LoAs often prescribe standardized phraseology and specific timing requirements for coordination and transfer of control to minimize communication errors. Controllers should use the agreed phraseology consistently and initiate coordination actions within the prescribed time frames, typically measured in nautical miles or minutes from the FIR boundary.

## 7.6 Special Conditions & Exceptions
Some LoAs contain clauses for special conditions or exceptions, such as contingencies during equipment failure, adverse weather, or traffic surges. Controllers must be aware of these provisions and apply them as required, ensuring flexible yet safe management of traffic under varying operational circumstances.
